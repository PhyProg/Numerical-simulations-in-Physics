# Numerical-simulations-in-Physics

This repository contains numerical simulations of some physical processes, mainly written during faculty and internships at Institute of Physics, Belgrade. 

Codes are:

  1. *Phonon spectra*: 
        - Codes for computing phonon spectra of nonpolar and polar semiconducting materials written during internship at 
          Institute of Physics in Belgrade;
  
  2. *3-Body problem*:
        - Codes for solving 3-body problem and searching for periodic solution written during internship at Institute 
          of Physics in Belgrade. It is incomplete for some private reasons;
          
  3. *Ionosphere*:
        - Codes for computing various parameters that describe physical processes in lower ionosphere written during first
          few months of internship at Institute of Physics in Belgrade;
          
 And will be updated with more simulations occasionally.
